            Behind every Naksh Band border stands an artisan whose craft
            has been refined over decades.
            <br /><br />
            Their hands carry memory.  
            Their discipline carries responsibility.  
            Their mastery carries Banaras.
            <br /><br />
            We honour them by protecting their craft with dignity,
            fair partnership, and long-term stewardship.
