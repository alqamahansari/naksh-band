        Why Banarasi Matters
      </h2>

        Banarasi weaving is not a product — it is a living heritage preserved in Varanasi.  
        <br /><br />
        Every authentic Banarasi fabric carries cultural memory, technical mastery,
        and a discipline that cannot be replicated outside this sacred geography.
        <br /><br />
        Naksh Band exists to protect this legacy with integrity and respect.
